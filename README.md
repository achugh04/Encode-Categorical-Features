Handling Categorical Variables :<br>
Handling Categorical/Qualitative variables is an important step in data preprocessing.Many Machine learning algorithms can not handle categorical variables by themself unless we convert them to numerical values.
And performance of ML algorithms is based on how Categorical variables are encoded. The results produced by the model varies from different encoding techniques used.

Categorical variables can be divided into two categories:<br>
1. Nominal (No particular order) 
2. Ordinal (some ordered).
